# UIService
---

A [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase SDK](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).


## Work in Progress Instructions

In the current incarnation, when the service starts it creates the sqlite database schema, and populates initial data therein. This includes the admin user, ui_service_admin. A token for this user may be used to add alerts.

See the scripts ```test/manual```. Running the script 'send.sh' with an argument set to the base name for an accompanying json file will send the associated json-rpc payload.

E.g.

```bash
KB_TOKEN=XXXMYTOKENXXX bash send.sh add-alert
```
