mongo:

using kitematic

install new mongo container, 3.6.6

add authentication

MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=dev_root
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=dev_r00t

map data directories to host file system

you may need to stop, clear the database (remove all files in the data directories) and restart in order for the root user and pwd to be installed

start the mongo instance

use compass to create the database and collection 

now log in from the command line (host) as the root user

now create a user with read/write permissions

db.createUser({user: "ui_service", pwd: "ui_service", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "ui_service"}]})

back in the ui service, you will need to set the host to mongo.
